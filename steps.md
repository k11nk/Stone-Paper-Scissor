flex direction:-
the "column" direction refers to the orientation of flex items within a flex container along the block axis, which is typically vertical.

When you set the direction of a flex container to "column", it means that the flex items will be stacked vertically within the container, with each item occupying a separate row

justify content v/s align-items:-
Use "justify-content" to control the alignment of flex items along the main axis.
Use "align-items" to control the alignment of flex items along the cross axis.
